About Me
</h2>
<p>
Hi! My name is Peter Monroe and I am from Chicago, IL, but I am currently living in Nashville, TN. I am 25 years old and have three brothers. I graduated from Grinnell College in 2011 with a degree in History. But at Grinnell I also found my love for programming. Growing up I was a big athlete. I love to play baseball, basketball, tennis, and pretty much everything else. My other passion is reading. I can't read enough. I love all kinds of books, histories, biographies, fantasy, science  fiction, classics, mysteries, comic books, and pretty much anything I get my hands on. I am a naturally curious person who loves to solve and find solutions to problems.

Why am I a good candidate?
</h2>
<p>
What makes me a good candidate is my passion for programming. In college I studied history, because I really couldn't find anything I liked better. And then one semester, my friend told me to check out a computer science class. It was an introductory class and I immediately fell in love. After that I took a few more programming classes and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. My computer science courses quickly became my favorite classes and I spent much of my time focused on that class. However it was too late to change my major. So I graduated with a degree in history, no really sure how to get into the programming world. Then one day I heard about programming bootcamps, like Launch Academy. I examined them and weighed the positives and negatives. I even asked that same friend who originally invited me to take a computer science class for advice. And with all that I decided that Launch Academy would be a good fit for me and a good way to start my career in programming.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, what makes me a good candidate for this program is my dedication. My desire to enter the programming world is very high. I am motivated to make this happen and actually quite look forward to the fast pace and intensive training. I am a very quick learner, especially when I am excited about something. Obviously my background might not be as impressive as others, but my dedication to learning and pursuing a career in programming is unmatched. Launch Academy seems to be a good fit for me, because of the "learning by doing" approach. This has always been my approach to learn. As a history major, of course I love to read. But I have always found an interactive experience helps me learn a lot more. So when I read that I would get to spend 6-8 hours of class time coding, I became very interested in the program. It seems to be the perfect fit for how I like to learn. I realize it will be intense. Maybe stressful or frustrating at times. But I handle pressure very well. The past two years I have spent doing very stressful, very difficult work in the beautiful country of Moldova for more than 80 hours a week, every week, with no vacations. So I am ready, willing, and able to take on the Launch Academy experience.
<br />
<br />
In addition to being a motivated student, I also work very well with others. Growing up playing sports really instilled in me the importance of teamwork. And I like that Launch Academy  incorporates this aspect of the industry into its program. Overall I believe that Launch Academy is a perfect fit for me. The program offered seems well suited for the way I learn. Also, I also am just excited for the opportunity to break into the programming world. After graduation, I didn't see that as an option for me without a lot more schooling, but Launch Academy offers me the opportunity in a much shorter amount of time.
